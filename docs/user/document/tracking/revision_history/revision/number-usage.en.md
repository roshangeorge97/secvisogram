# Number - Usage

The version number should be included in each revision history element.
The value is the version that was published or is derived from that version.

Must not be `0` or `0.y.z` if the document status (`/document/tracking/status`) is set to `final` or `interim`.

Must not include pre-release nor build metadata information.
