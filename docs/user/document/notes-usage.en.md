# Notes - Usage

For CSAF advisories that contain a `product_tree`, a short description of the products should be included.
This should have the category `description` and the title "Product Description".
In this note, the product should be described in more detail in terms of functionality and benefits in a few sentences.
This applies analogously to product families.

Another element with title "General Security Recommendations" and category `general` should be created.

Another element of the category `summary` that summarizes vulnerabilities should be created.

Adding a legal disclaimer for the document is encouraged.

FAQs, if not vulnerability specific, belong in this section.
