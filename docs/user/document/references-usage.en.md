# References - Usage

All links that have any relevance in the overall context of the document should be listed here.
This could include for example original advisories or advisories of the manufacturer or especially the coordinator.
If other advisories (especially from suppliers) are referenced, they should be listed here.

There should be one reference item that provides a canonical URL for this document, i.e. it has the category `self`, the `url` starts with `https://` and ends with a valid filename for the CSAF document according to the rules in section 5.1. of the specification.

It is recommended to link the recommended cybersecurity best practices of the team where advisories are found.

CVE entries should only be linked in the corresponding vulnerability item.
