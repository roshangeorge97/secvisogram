# Summary - Usage

A meaningful title or short summary of the reference.

For web pages it's often the page title from the HTML metadata.
For other documents it's the document's title.

For different versions of Advisories it has the following format:

  `ID: - TITLE - FORMAT VERSION`

where `ID` is the value of `document/tracking/id`, `TITLE` is optional and the value of `document/title`, `FORMAT` is one of `PDF`, `TXT`, `CSAF` or `HTML` and `VERSION` is the document's version.
