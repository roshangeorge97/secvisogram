# Product Status - Usage

The product status provides information on the status products in the `product_tree` are in.

Generally, vulnerable (`known_affected`) and fixed (`fixes`) versions of products should be given.

The products are listed by their ID in different lists of product status groups.
The same product ID must not be member of contradicting product status groups.
I.e. a product listed in the group of _affected_ products may not be listed again in the group of _not affected_ products.

The contradicting groups are

* affected

  * `product_status/first_affected[]`
  * `product_status/known_affected[]`
  * `product_status/last_affected[]`

* not affected

  * `product_status/known_not_affected[]`

* fixed

  * `product_status/first_fixed[]`
  * `product_status/fixed[]`

* under investigation:

  * `product_status/under_investigation[]`

> Note: An issuer might recommend (product_status/recommended) a product version from any group - also from the
> affected group, i.e. if it was discovered that fixed versions introduce a more severe vulnerability.

Each product listed in the affected group should be listed in the remediations (`vulnerabilities[]/remediations`).

For each product listed in the not affected group, the reason why it is not affected should be given.
This reason should be listed in the threats (`vulnerabilities[]/threats`) with category `impact` (Impact Statement) or as machine-readable Impact Statement in the flags (`vulnerabilities[]/flags`).
It is recommended to use both.

The status `known_not_affected` is used in the context of security advisories to exclude individual products. This is mainly used for products that are likely to be affected.
To define general non-affectedness, the VEX profile should be used.

An issuer might recommend (`product_status/recommended`) a product version from any group - also from the affected group, i.e. if it was discovered that fixed versions introduce a more severe vulnerability.
If more than one product version is patched, the author can also specify which version is recommended.
If there are two patched versions of a vulnerability that contain different vulnerabilities, the recommended field can also be used to specify which version is recommended for use.

Version boundaries can be represented in the `first_*` and `last_*` fields.
For simplification, elements from `first_*` and `last_*` should also be listed in the main groups `known_*`.

For products listed in `under_investigation` it is expected that the outcome of analysis are reported in a later version of the document.
